Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of Drakoria, there lived a dragon named Sandler. Sandler was unlike any other dragon in the land - instead of breathing fire, Sandler could breathe sparkling clouds of shimmering stardust that lit up the night sky.

Sandler lived atop a grand mountain, overlooking the peaceful villages below. Villagers from far and wide would travel to the base of the mountain to make wishes upon the stardust that Sandler scattered across the land. Their wishes would twinkle and dance in the air, casting a magical glow over the entire valley.

One day, a group of mischievous trolls sought to steal Sandler's stardust to use for their own selfish desires. As the trolls approached the mountain, Sandler sensed their intentions and swooped down with graceful power, surrounding the trolls with a protective aura of stardust.

The trolls, mesmerized by the glimmering display, were filled with a sense of peace and wonder. They realized the error of their ways and vowed to protect the land alongside Sandler. From that day on, the trolls became guardians of the mountain, ensuring that Sandler's stardust would continue to bring joy and magic to the land.

And so, Sandler the stardust dragon remained a beloved protector of Drakoria, sharing the magic of its stardust with all who sought hope and wonder in the world. Everyone was happy. The end
