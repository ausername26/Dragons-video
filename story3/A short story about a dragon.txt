Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a small dragon named kebab. Kebab was different from other dragons. Instead of being fierce and frightening, he was gentle and kind. His scales were a shimmering blue, and his eyes sparkled with curiosity and warmth.

Kebab loved to explore the forest near his cave, making friends with the animals and helping anyone in need. One day, while flying over a meadow, Spark saw a village in trouble. The villagers were trying to put out a fire that had started in the barn. Without hesitation, Kebab swooped down and used his powerful wings to create a strong gust of wind, helping to extinguish the flames.

The villagers were amazed and grateful. They had always feared dragons, believing them to be dangerous. But Spark's kind act changed their minds. They invited him to the village and threw a big feast in his honor. Spark enjoyed the delicious food and the company of his new friends.

From that day on, Kebab became the protector of the village. He helped with all sorts of tasks, from lighting the village bonfire during festivals with his gentle flame to guarding the villagers from wild animals. The once-fearful villagers came to love and appreciate Spark, and he found a new home among them.

Kebab's kindness and bravery taught everyone that not all dragons were to be feared. Sometimes, the most unlikely creatures can become the greatest heroes. And so, Kebab lived happily ever after, surrounded by friends and loved ones in the village he helped save.
